            This is an exciting story, where we get involved in a gigantic
            world, where music takes us by the hand on an adventure like no
            other. And although the graphics were never state-of-the-art, the
            feeling of a living environment sends chills down your spine.

          <h2>A story that changed the perspective of JRPG games.</h2>
          <p>
            the immensity and beauty of the landscapes together with a musical
            environment as deep as spiritual, a story rich in characters and a
            great variety of missions make the game an innumerable piece.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some of the best memories about this game were the immense hours of
            fun and entertainment that it produced in my mind, at that time I
            think 2012, the situation in my country was very dense, not much
            less to understand that I lived in that moment. the Isla de
            Margarita, an island that was affected by the economic crisis that
            Venezuela was facing at that time
          </p>
          <p>
            Being able to escape from the situation in my country through this
            video game was something magical, I remember the times I entered the
            Eryth Sea zone, just an excuse to listen to the music and enjoy a
            wonderful meditation, this is one of the most powerful features of
            this videogame, the interaction between music and the environment
          </p>
          <p>
            In my particular case, the story was not the main reason why I was
            fascinated by this game, but I would like to consider that the story
            is captivating and surprising, we can see nuances of other rpg games
            but nothing to shock
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding the graphics, we could consider that they were not the
            best of their time, obviously due to the low capacity of the Wii,
            but despite these technical barriers, the Monolith Software team did
            the impossible to show the best landscapes, delightful from any type
            of player, with a color palette accompanied by music and interaction
            make an unforgettable experience
          </p>
          <h2>To end this experience</h2>
          <p>
            Finally, we could summarize that it was a wonderful story, full of
            unforgettable moments with a complex but enjoyable gameplay and a
            vast world full of splendid landscapes, with music that moves even
            the toughest. undoubtedly had everything to catapult himself into a
            total success, a legend and 13 years later a fabulous franchise.

            <p class="titles"><strong>The big problem</strong></p>
            <p>
              2010 when the Nintendo Wii was attacked by childish games and low
              power. The world was looking for highly prestigious western games
              and great graphic power, everyone wanted a GTA on Nintendo but
              really the focus of the Japanese giant was another.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="titles"><strong>fears for not believing</strong></p>
            <p>
              It was a time when the Japanese rpg had lost prestige due to the
              lack of innovation, big companies did not sell titles like before,
              and Nintendo never thought of releasing this title outside of
              Japan for fear of economic losses.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p class="titles"><strong>The secret weapon</strong></p>
            <p>
              It is believing in good stories, having the best professionals on
              your side, as is the case with MONOLITHSOFT, they were able to
              make the most of the wii hardware creating what could be one of
              the greatest games in history.
